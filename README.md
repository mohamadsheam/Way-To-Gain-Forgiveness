**Here are 21 tips from our Prophet (saws) to help you erase your sins :**

**1. Repenting**

Allah says : "O son of Adam, so long as you call upon Me and ask of Me, I shall forgive you for what you have done, and I shall not mind. O son of Adam, if your sins reached the clouds of the sky and if you then ask forgiveness of Me, I will forgive you. O son of Adam, were you to come to Me with sins nearly as great as the earth and were you then to face Me, ascribing no partner to Me, I would bring you forgiveness nearly as great as it." [Hadith Qudsi]

**2. Performing Prayer**

The Prophet (saws) said :"When the time for a prayer comes, if any muslim performs ablution well and offers his prayer with humility and bowing, it will be an expiation for his past sins, so long as he has not committed a major sin; and this applies to for all times." [ Muslim ]

**3. Performing Wudhu (ablution)**

The Prophet (saws) said :"He who performed ablution well, his sins would come out from his body, even coming out from under his nails." [ Sahih Muslim ]

**4) Attending the Jumu'ah Salah (Friday Prayer)**

The Prophet (saws) said :"The five prayers and from one Friday prayer to (the next) Friday prayer is an expiation (of the sins committed in between their intervals) if major sins are not committed." [ Sahih Muslim ].
"Whoever takes a bath on Friday, purifies himself as much as he can, then uses his (hair) oil or perfumes himself with the scent of his house, then proceeds (for Jumua prayer) and does not separate two persons sitting together (in the mosque), then prays as much as (Allah has) written for him and then remains silent while the Imam is delivering the Khutba, his sins in-between the present and the last Friday would be forgiven." [ Sahih Al-Bukhari ]

**5) Waiting for Prayer**

Messenger of Allah (S.A.W.S) asked : "Shall I not tell you of something by means of which Allah erases sins and raises you in status?". They said :"Yes, O Messenger of Allah." He (saws) said : "Doing wudoo' well even when it is difficult, taking many steps to the mosques and waiting for praying after prayer. That is (equivalent) to guarding the frontier." [ Muslim ]

**6) Doing good deeds**

Do more good deeds because Allah said :" Verily, the good deeds remove the evil deeds (small sins)." [ Quran : 11 verse 114 ]

**7) Performing Umrah and Hajj**

The Prophet (saws) said :"Whoever performs Hajj for Allah's pleasure and does not have sexual relations with his wife, and does not do evil or sins then he will return (after Hajj free from all sins) as if he were born anew." [ Sahih Al-Bukhari ]
"The performance of Umra is an expiation for the sins committed (between it and the previous one). And the reward of Hajj Mabrur (the one accepted by Allah) is nothing except Paradise." [ Sahih Al-Bukhari ]

**8) Saying 'Ameen' after the Imam**

The Prophet (saws) said :"When the Imam says 'Ameen', you should all say 'Ameen' at that time, and he whose 'Ameen' coincides with the 'Ameen' of the angels, all his past sins will be forgiven." [ Bukhari ]

**9) Calling out Adhaan**

The Prophet (saws) said :"The muadhin (the one who call out the prayer) will receive forgiveness to the extent to which his voice reaches, and every moist and dry place will testify on his behalf; and he who attends (the congregation of) prayer will have 25 prayers recorded for him." [ Aby Dawud ]

**10) Walking to the Prayer Place**

The Prophet (saws) said :"If he performs ablution completely and then goes to the mosque with the sole intention of perfoming the prayer, and nothing urges him to proceed to the mosque except the prayer, then on every step which he takes towards the mosque, he will be raised one degree or one of his sins will be forgiven. The angels will keep on asking Allah's forgiveness and blessings for everyone of you so long as he keeps sitting at his praying place. The angels will say, 'O Allah, bless him! O Allah, be merciful to him!' as long as he does not do a thing which gives trouble to others." [ Bukhari ]

**11) Giving charity**

The Prophet (saws) said :"The charity erases the bad deed like the water puts out the fire." [ Tirmidhi ]

**12) Asking forgiveness from others on wronging them**

The Prophet (saws) said :"Whoever has oppressed another persons concerning his reputation or anything else, he should beg him to forgive him before the Day of Ressurection when there will be no money (to compensate for wrong deeds), but if he has good deeds, those good deeds will taken from him according to his oppression which he has done, and if he has no good deeds, the sins of the oppressed person will be loaded on him." [ Bukhari ]

**13) Reciting Salawaat (Blessings) on Prophet Muhammad S.A.W.S**

The Prophet (saws) said :"He who sends blessings on me once Allah sends blessings on him ten times and removes from him ten times and raises him by ten degrees." [ al-Nasa'i ]

**14) Being kind to animals**

The Prophet (saws) said :"A prostitute was forgiven by Allah, because passing by a panting dog near a well and seeing that the dog was about to die of thirst, she took off her shoe, and tying it with head-cover she drew out some water for it. So Allah forgave her because of that." [ Sahih Al-Bukhari ]

**15) Praising Allah after Eating Food**

The Prophet (saws) said :" He who has taken food and says at the end : Al-hamdu lillahi-lladhi at'amani hadha, wa razaqanihi min ghairi haulin minni wa la quwwatin (All praise is due to Allah Who has given me food to eat and provided it without any endeavor on my part or any power), all his past (minor) sins will be forgiven." [ At-Tirmidhi ]

**16) Removing Obstacles from the Road or Way**

The Prophet (saws) said :" While a man was on the way, he found a thorny branch of tree on the way and removed it. Allah thanked him for that deed and forgave him (his sins)." [ Bukhari ]

**17) Hide Other's faults and sins**

The Prophet (saws) said :" He who conceals (the faults) of a Muslim, Allah would conceal his faults in the world and in the Hereafter. Allah is at the back of a servant so long as the servant is at the back of his brother." [ Sahih Muslim ]
He (saws) also said :" The believer will be brought close to his Lord until He conceals him and makes him confess hin sin. Allah will say, 'Do you remember such and such a sin?' The man will say, 'Yes, I admit it.' The Lord will say, 'I concealed it for you in the world and I forgave you for it today." [ Bukhari ]

**18) Observing Patience during Hard Times**

The Prophet (saws) said :" Whenever a believer is stricken with a calamity (discomfort, illness, anxiety, grief or worry), even the pricking of a thorn, his sins are expiated for him." [ Bukhari, Muslim ]
He (saws) also said :" When Allah loves someone He tests them, as for whoever is content Allah is pleased with him, and as for whoever is discontented, Allah is displeased with him." [Tirmidhi, classed as Hasan]

**19) Making some dhikr**

The Prophet (saws) said :" Whoever says, 'Subhan Allahi wa bihamdihi', 100 times a day, will be forgiven all his sins even if they were as much as the foam of the sea." [ Sahih Al-Bukhari ]

He (saws) said :" If anyone glorifies Allah after every prayer 33 times (SubhanAllah), and praises Allah 33 times (Alhamdulillah), and declares His Greatness 33 times ( Allah hu Akbar ), ninety-nine times in all, and to complete a hundred says : 'La ilaaha illal-lah wahdahu la sharika lahu, lahul-mulk wa lahul-hamd wa huwa 'alaa kulli shai-in qadeer' his sins will be forgiven even if these are as abundant as the foam of the sea." [ Sahih Muslim ] 

He (saws) said :" If anyone says: Astaghfirullah-alladhi la ilaaha illa Huwal-Haiyyul-Qayyoumu, wa atoubi ilaihi ( I seek forgiveness of Allah besides Whom there is non worthy of worship, the Ever-Living, the Self-Subsisting, and I turn to Him in repentance ), his sins will be forgiven even if he should have run away from the battlefield." In another narration, these words are to be repeated 3 times. [ Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi and Al-Hakim ] 

He (saws) said :" If anyone sits in an assembly where there is clamor and says before getting up to leave 'Subhanaka Allahumma wa bihamdika, ash-hadu Allah ilaaha illa-anta, astaghfiruka wa atubu ilayka' (Glory to be to You, O Allah, I begin with declaring all praise is to You, I testify there is no god but You; I ask Your pardon & turn to You in repentance), he will be forgiven any sin (of the tongue) he might have committed in that assembly." [ Tirmidhi]

**20) Saying 'Subhan-Allah' 100 times**

Sa'd bin Abu Waqqas ( May Allah be pleased with him ) reported : We were with the Messenger of Allah (SAWS) when he asked :"Is anyone of you unable to earn a thousand good deeds?" One of those present asked: "How can one earn thousand good deeds in a day?" He (SAWS) replied :"By saying :'SubhanAllah 100 times, then 1000 good deeds will be recorded for him or 1000 sins will be blotted out from his record." [ Muslim ]

**21) The best duaa for seeking forgiveness is to say :**

"Allahuma Anta Rabbi, la ilaha illa Anta, khalaqtani wa ana 'abduka, wa ana 'ala 'ahdika wa wa'dika mastata'tu, a'udhu bika min sharri ma sana'tu, abu'u laka bini'matika 'alayya, wa abu'u laka bidhanbi faghfir li, fa innahu la yaghfirudh-dhunuba illa Anta." (O Allah! You are my Lord. There is no god except You. You have created, I am Your slave, I hold to Your Covenant as far as I can. I seek refuge in You from the evil of what I have done. I acknowledge the favours that You have bestowed upon me and I confess my sins. Pardon me, for none but You has the power to pardon). He who supplicates in these terms during the day with firm belief in it and dies on the same day (before the evening), he will be one of the dwellers of Jannah; anf if anyone supplicates in these terms during the night with firm belief in it and dies before the morning, he will be one of he dwellers of Jannah." [ Al-Bukhari ]

May Allah erase our sins and save us from the torment of Hell. Ameen
